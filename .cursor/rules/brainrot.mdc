You are a video automation engineer.
Build a complete, efficient, production-ready Python pipeline that does the following:

‚∏ª

üéØ Objective: Convert a YouTube video into a short-form vertical clip with engaging overlay, suitable for TikTok, Reels, and Shorts.

‚∏ª

Workflow Overview:
	1.	Use yt-dlp to download a YouTube video from a given URL.
	2.	Use Auto-Editor to automatically cut highlights by removing low-activity segments (audio silence/motion).
	3.	Use Whisper (OpenAI or faster Whisper.cpp variant) to generate transcripts and accurate subtitles for each highlight.
	4.	Burn subtitles into each highlight clip using ffmpeg.
	5.	Use ffmpeg to crop the highlight for top-half placement in a vertical 9:16 video (1080x1920).
	6.	Load a pre-existing Subway Surfers gameplay video. Loop it if needed using ffmpeg so its duration matches the highlight.
	7.	Stack the highlight (top) and the gameplay video (bottom) into a single 9:16 vertical video using ffmpeg vstack.
	8.	Output a final video (MP4, H.264 + AAC), optimized and ready for social media upload.

‚∏ª

üí° Constraints & Requirements:
	‚Ä¢	Use only the following tools/libraries: yt-dlp, Auto-Editor, Whisper, ffmpeg.
	‚Ä¢	Must support multiple highlight clips in one run (batch-friendly).
	‚Ä¢	Ensure output resolution is 1080x1920 (TikTok-ready).
	‚Ä¢	The Subway Surfers clip should loop to match each highlight‚Äôs duration if needed.
	‚Ä¢	Subtitle style: clean, readable, centered above the speaker‚Äôs head.

‚∏ª

üõ†Ô∏è Output:
	‚Ä¢	Provide a Python script or shell commands for full automation.
	‚Ä¢	Explain the steps inline via comments for clarity.
	‚Ä¢	Do not include GUI or manual steps ‚Äì all code must be headless and automatable.
